# WARNING
These certificates/private keys held in credentials/examples are here for testing only. Do not use these certificates/keys
in production, as by the nature of being on this repository they are publicly available. In practice, avoid at all costs
putting credentials into a version controlled project. The `.gitignore`s here and in the folder above make it
hard to check in keys here, so please do not force add any to the repo.
